# Adobe Bridge (2022) Scripts
## Bump Exposure
Lightens or darkens a series of images while preserving the individual exposure corrections. Very often I'd work at night, and the next morning realize that the whole set is just a tad too dark. Now I can bump up the brightness of the entire series with one click. Tested on NEF files with XMP sidecars.
